Python
======
This app requires Python 3
I recommend using a virtual environment to run all the parts of this app
$ virtualenv -p python3 .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate

all the required libraries are listed in requirements.txt and can be installed
with pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt


Database
========
You'll need to load the questions into a sqlite database called challenge.db
The csv file containing the questions is NOT stored in the git repo!
$ python3 parse_questions.py path/to/question_dump.csv challenge.db


Javascript
==========
All the required javascript packages are in package.json; install all
dependencies by running
$ npm install

The live javascript must be built with webpack
$ ./node_packages/.bin/webpack

Server
======
Simply run the server with python
$ python3 app.py
and access it at http://localhost:5000/
